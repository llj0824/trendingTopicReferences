            "description": "In this episode, we're joined by Dr. Paul Conti MD, a renowned psychiatrist and author of 'Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic.' Our discussion delves into the profound impact of trauma on society, exploring its links to generational trauma, intergenerational trauma, and collective trauma. Dr. Conti provides a comprehensive look at how trauma manifests in conditions such as PTSD and substance abuse, and how neuroscience is unveiling new paths for healing and recovery. Throughout our conversation, Dr. Conti shares insights on the nature of trauma, its lasting effects on brain function, and its pervasive influence on both physical and mental health. We discuss the science of trauma, highlighting its intergenerational transmission and the ways it shapes our behaviors and health outcomes. Dr. Conti also touches on the importance of understanding trauma's impact on the immune system, cardiovascular health, and overall well-being. Additionally, Dr. Conti provides practical advice on trauma prevention and treatment, emphasizing the need for compassionate curiosity and self-reflection. We explore how societal attitudes towards mental health are evolving and the importance of addressing trauma at both individual and collective levels.
